# HW 3

The goal of this homework is to predict whether the answer to a trivia question is correct or not. Thus, it is a binary classification problem. 

### About the Data
Quiz bowl is an academic competition between schools in English-speaking countries; hundreds of teams compete in dozens of tournaments each year. Quiz bowl is different from Jeopardy, a recent application area. While Jeopardy also uses signaling devices, these are only usable after a question is completed (interrupting Jeopardy's questions would make for bad television). Thus, Jeopardy is rapacious classification followed by a race---among those who know the answer---to punch a button first.  
  
  Itâ€™s very easy to generate guesses (in fact, we could generate every possible guess). The challenge is knowing whether any given guess is good or not. We can treat this as a classification problem. Every guess can be described by features that measure how well it matches the question. The classifier tells us whether we got the question wrong or right.
